Hi everyone!
This tool I developed is (very) raw example of how an antivirus should work. Future updates will be more like a real antivirus,
having a better indexing engine, real hashes, the possibility of updating signatures and selecting the source where to init 
the scan. This software is developed for the IT fundamentals course of computer engineering at Third University of Rome, and 
is meant to be a more funny exercise
